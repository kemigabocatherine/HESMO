               <p class="story">Pastor Edward Arnold Kayemba starts <b>HESMO CHRISTIAN RELIEF</b> after three years of paying school
                  fees
                  for 24 underprivileged children and taking care of 15 single mothers suffering under the yoke of
                  poverty.
                  The inception of <b>HESMO</b> was fuelled by a phone call between Mr. Kayemba and a church friend who
                  detailed to him the ordeal of a single mother to a newly born who was forced to leave hospital
                  and
                  spend a night in the cold of a church veranda with her infant child because she did not have
                  money to
                  cover her hospital bills. Obeying to the voice of God, Mr. Kayemba started this ministry that
                  would offer
                  both spiritual and physical deliverance to single mothers and less privileged children by
                  biblical teaching
                  of the gospel of deliverance and a steady supply of basic needs.</p>
